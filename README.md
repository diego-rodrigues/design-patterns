# Design Patterns

---

This repository is meant to be a demonstration of several design patterns. 

Design Patterns are typical solutions to recurring problems when designing software. 

Unlike algorithms, which define steps to solve a problem, design patterns establish blueprints
to help design how to structure and manage interaction between classes.

Most of the content of this repository is based on [this page](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns).

Solutions to the exercises can be found in the branch `solutions`.
